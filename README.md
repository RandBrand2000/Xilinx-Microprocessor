This repository contains the simplified microprocessor simulated in Xilinx for the final project of a VLSI course.
There are three things contained in this repository:
  1 .V files      - Verilog files that make the project itself
  2 PDF           - This file shows simulation outcomes for the seperate blocks in the microprocessor
  3 Project file  - The zip file produced by Xilenx containing all the project files needed to run with Xilenx
